# Lamport

An academic exercise in building a distributed system, named in honor of Turing Award Winner [Leslie Lamport](http://www.lamport.org/). The purpose of this project is to explore the complexities involved with building a distributed computing system. The origins of this project are a [2016 presentation](http://www.meetup.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/events/230054258/) for the [Distributed Computing Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/) Meetup group. 

## Developer Setup

To get your local development environment setup, follow these steps:

1. Take a moment to walkthrough the [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install) page to setup your local Go development environment,
2. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the [first time Git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup).
3. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/lamport.git`

Lamport uses Git tags to provide developers with a way to see incremental features being added to the project. A new developer will want to fetch the lowest numbered tag/feature. The wiki will be updated to provide users context on the feature that was added, as well as some design decisions that imfluenced the choices.

## Running

Coming soon will be build scripts and infrastructure as code that will allow you to get Lamport and it's depedencies up and running (pull requests are very much welcome). The idea is that operations folks can run Lamport to get a feel for running a distributed system. Lamport intends to be fully operationalized as each feature is added. Stay tuned for more details.
