An academic exercise in building a distributed system, named in honor of Turing Award Winner [Leslie Lamport](http://www.lamport.org/). The purpose of this project is to explore the complexities involved with building a distributed computing system. The origins of this project are a [2016 presentation](http://www.meetup.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/events/230054258/) for the [Distributed Computing Denver](http://www.meetup.com/Distributed-Computing-Denver/) Meetup group.
