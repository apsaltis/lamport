#Contributing to Lamport

We welcome, and encourage, developers of all skill-levels to contribute to Lamport. Please do not hesitate to contribute because of fear of public shame, embarassment, or making mistakes. We're interested in providing a safe and constructive project for everyone interested in learning about distributed systems.

# Issues

Future enhancements are added to the issue section of the project as discussed on the Lamport Developers Google Group. These issues are labeled as "enhancement", and "help wanted". This is the best place to start if you'd like to make a contribution.
